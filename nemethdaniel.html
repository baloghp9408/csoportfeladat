<p>The Ducati Panigale V4 is a sport bike with a desmodromic 90° V4 engine introduced by Ducati in 20
     18 as the successor to the V-twin engined 1299.
     The name "Panigale" comes from the small manufacturing town of Borgo
 Panigale.[4] The Panigale V4 uses the new Desmosedici Stradale V4 eng
 ine, derived from the Desmosedici MotoGP racing engine.
The Panigale V4 S is a more performance-oriented version of the base V4. 
It has an Öhlins suspension that the rider can electronically adjust, or set 
to the sport, race, or street modes typical of contemporary performance bikes. 
It also has a lightweight lithium battery, and forged aluminium wheels, 
reducing the bike's overall weight
